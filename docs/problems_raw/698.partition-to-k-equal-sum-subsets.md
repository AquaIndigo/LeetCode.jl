Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, find whether
it's possible to divide this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are
all equal.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1], k = 4    
	Output: True    
	Explanation: It's possible to divide it into 4 subsets (5), (1, 4), (2,3), (2,3) with equal sums.    



**Note:**

  * `1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16`.
  * `0 < nums[i] < 10000`.


**Code:**
