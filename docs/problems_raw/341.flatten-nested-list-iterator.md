Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be
integers or other lists.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]    
	Output: [1,1,2,1,1]    
	Explanation: By calling _next_ repeatedly until _hasNext_ returns false,                  the order of elements returned by _next_ should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: [1,[4,[6]]]    
	Output: [1,4,6]    
	Explanation: By calling _next_ repeatedly until _hasNext_ returns false,                  the order of elements returned by _next_ should be: [1,4,6].    


**Code:**
