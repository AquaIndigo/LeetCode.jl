A string is called a  _happy prefix_  if is a **non-empty** prefix which is
also a suffix (excluding itself).

Given a string `s`. Return the **longest happy prefix**  of `s` .

Return an empty string if no such prefix exists.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: s = "level"    
	Output: "l"    
	Explanation: s contains 4 prefix excluding itself ("l", "le", "lev", "leve"), and suffix ("l", "el", "vel", "evel"). The largest prefix which is also suffix is given by "l".    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: s = "ababab"    
	Output: "abab"    
	Explanation: "abab" is the largest prefix which is also suffix. They can overlap in the original string.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: s = "leetcodeleet"    
	Output: "leet"    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: s = "a"    
	Output: ""    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
  * `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
