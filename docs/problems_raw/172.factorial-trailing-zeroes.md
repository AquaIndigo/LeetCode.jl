Given an integer `n`, return _the number of trailing zeroes in`n!`_.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time
complexity?



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: n = 3    
	Output: 0    
	Explanation:  3! = 6, no trailing zero.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: n = 5    
	Output: 1    
	Explanation:  5! = 120, one trailing zero.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: n = 0    
	Output: 0    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= n <= 104`


**Code:**
