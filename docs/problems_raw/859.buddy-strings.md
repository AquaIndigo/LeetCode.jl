Given two strings `A` and `B` of lowercase letters, return `true` _if you can
swap two letters in_`A` _so the result is equal to_`B` _, otherwise,
return_`false` _._

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such
that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `A[i]` and `A[j]`. For example,
swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: A = "ab", B = "ba"    
	Output: true    **Explanation** **:** You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to B.    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: A = "ab", B = "ab"    
	Output: false    **Explanation** **:** The only letters you can swap are A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != B.    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: A = "aa", B = "aa"    
	Output: true    **Explanation** **:** You can swap A[0] = 'a' and A[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to B.    

**Example 4:**
            
	Input: A = "aaaaaaabc", B = "aaaaaaacb"    
	Output: true    

**Example 5:**
            
	Input: A = "", B = "aa"    
	Output: false    



**Constraints:**

  * `0 <= A.length <= 20000`
  * `0 <= B.length <= 20000`
  * `A` and `B` consist of lowercase letters.


**Code:**
