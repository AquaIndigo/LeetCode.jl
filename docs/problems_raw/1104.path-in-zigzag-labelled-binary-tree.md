In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are
labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is
left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...),
the labelling is right to left.

Given the `label` of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from
the root of the tree to the node with that `label`.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: label = 14    
	Output: [1,3,4,14]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: label = 26    
	Output: [1,2,6,10,26]    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= label <= 10^6`


**Code:**
