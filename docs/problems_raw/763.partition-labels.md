A string `S` of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this
string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most
one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: S = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"    
	Output: [9,7,8]    
	Explanation:    The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".    This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.    A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits S into less parts.    



**Note:**

  * `S` will have length in range `[1, 500]`.
  * `S` will consist of lowercase English letters (`'a'` to `'z'`) only.




**Code:**
