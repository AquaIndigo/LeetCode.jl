Given a non-empty array of integers, return the **_k_** most frequent
elements.

**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2    
	Output: [1,2]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [1], k = 1    
	Output: [1]

**Note:**

  * You may assume _k_ is always valid, 1 ≤ _k_ ≤ number of unique elements.
  * Your algorithm's time complexity **must be** better than O( _n_ log _n_ ), where _n_ is the array's size.
  * It's guaranteed that the answer is unique, in other words the set of the top k frequent elements is unique.
  * You can return the answer in any order.
