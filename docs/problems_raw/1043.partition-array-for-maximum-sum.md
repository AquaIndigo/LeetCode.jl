Given an integer array `arr`, you should partition the array into (contiguous)
subarrays of length at most `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has their
values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return _the largest sum of the given array after partitioning._



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3    
	Output: 84    
	Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: arr = [1,4,1,5,7,3,6,1,9,9,3], k = 4    
	Output: 83    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: arr = [1], k = 1    
	Output: 1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= arr.length <= 500`
  * `0 <= arr[i] <= 109`
  * `1 <= k <= arr.length`


**Code:**
