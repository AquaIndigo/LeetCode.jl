You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order, and an
integer `target`.

Suppose that `nums` is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e.,
`[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

_If`target` is found in the array return its index, otherwise, return `-1`._



**Example 1:**
            
	Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0    
	Output: 4    

**Example 2:**
            
	Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3    
	Output: -1    

**Example 3:**
            
	Input: nums = [1], target = 0    
	Output: -1    



**Constraints:**

  * `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
  * `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
  * All values of `nums` are **unique**.
  * `nums` is guranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
  * `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4`


**Code:**
