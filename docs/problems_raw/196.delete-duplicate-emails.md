Write a SQL query to **delete** all duplicate email entries in a table named
`Person`, keeping only unique emails based on its _smallest_ **Id**.
            +----+------------------+    | Id | Email            |    +----+------------------+    | 1  | john@example.com |    | 2  | bob@example.com  |    | 3  | john@example.com |    +----+------------------+    Id is the primary key column for this table.    

For example, after running your query, the above `Person` table should have
the following rows:
            +----+------------------+    | Id | Email            |    +----+------------------+    | 1  | john@example.com |    | 2  | bob@example.com  |    +----+------------------+    

**Note:**

Your output is the whole `Person` table after executing your sql. Use `delete`
statement.


**Code:**
