Given a **non-empty** binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any node sequence from some starting
node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must
contain **at least one node** and does not need to go through the root.



**Example 1:**

	Input: root = [1,2,3]    
	Output: 6    

**Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)
            
	Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]    
	Output: 42    



**Constraints:**

  * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 3 * 104]`.
  * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`


**Code:**
