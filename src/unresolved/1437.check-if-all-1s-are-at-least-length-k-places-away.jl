# 
# Given an array `nums` of 0s and 1s and an integer `k`, return `True` if all
# 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `False`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_1_1791.png)**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
#     Output: true
#     Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
# **![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample_2_1791.png)**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
#     Output: false
#     Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], k = 0
#     Output: true
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [0,1,0,1], k = 1
#     Output: true
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
#   * `0 <= k <= nums.length`
#   * `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`
