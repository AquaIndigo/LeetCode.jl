# Write a SQL query to get the _n_ th highest salary from the `Employee` table.
# 
#     
#     
#     +----+--------+
#     | Id | Salary |
#     +----+--------+
#     | 1  | 100    |
#     | 2  | 200    |
#     | 3  | 300    |
#     +----+--------+
#     
# 
# For example, given the above Employee table, the _n_ th highest salary where
# _n_ = 2 is `200`. If there is no _n_ th highest salary, then the query should
# return `null`.
# 
#
