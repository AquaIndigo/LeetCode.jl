# 
# Given a list of daily temperatures `T`, return a list such that, for each day
# in the input, tells you how many days you would have to wait until a warmer
# temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0`
# instead.
# 
# For example, given the list of temperatures `T = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76,
# 73]`, your output should be `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`.
# 
# **Note:** The length of `temperatures` will be in the range `[1, 30000]`. Each
# temperature will be an integer in the range `[30, 100]`.
