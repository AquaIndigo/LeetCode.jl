# 
# Given a string `S`, check if the letters can be rearranged so that two
# characters that are adjacent to each other are not the same.
# 
# If possible, output any possible result.  If not possible, return the empty
# string.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: S = "aab"
#     Output: "aba"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: S = "aaab"
#     Output: ""
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * `S` will consist of lowercase letters and have length in range `[1, 500]`.
