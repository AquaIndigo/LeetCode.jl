# 
# Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all `0`'s to the end of it
# while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
#     Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
# 
# **Note** :
# 
#   1. You must do this **in-place** without making a copy of the array.
#   2. Minimize the total number of operations.
