# 
# Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a
# height balanced BST.
# 
# For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in
# which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than
# 1.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
#     
#     One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
#     
#           0
#          / \
#        -3   9
#        /   /
#      -10  5
#
