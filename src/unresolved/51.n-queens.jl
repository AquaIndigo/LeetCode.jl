# The **n-queens** puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n`
# chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
# 
# Given an integer `n`, return _all distinct solutions to the **n-queens
# puzzle**_.
# 
# Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens'
# placement, where `'Q'` and `'.'` both indicate a queen and an empty space,
# respectively.
#
