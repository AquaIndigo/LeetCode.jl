# 
# Write a SQL query to get the second highest salary from the `Employee` table.
# 
#     
#     
#     +----+--------+
#     | Id | Salary |
#     +----+--------+
#     | 1  | 100    |
#     | 2  | 200    |
#     | 3  | 300    |
#     +----+--------+
#     
# 
# For example, given the above Employee table, the query should return `200` as
# the second highest salary. If there is no second highest salary, then the
# query should return `null`.
#
