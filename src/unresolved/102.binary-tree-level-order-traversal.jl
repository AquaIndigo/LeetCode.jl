# 
# Given a binary tree, return the _level order_ traversal of its nodes' values.
# (ie, from left to right, level by level).
# 
# For example:  
# Given binary tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`,  
# 
#     
#     
#         3
#        / \
#       9  20
#         /  \
#        15   7
#     
# 
# return its level order traversal as:  
# 
#     
#     
#     [
#       [3],
#       [9,20],
#       [15,7]
#     ]
#
