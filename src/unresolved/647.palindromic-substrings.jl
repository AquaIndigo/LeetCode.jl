# Given a string, your task is to count how many palindromic substrings in this
# string.
# 
# The substrings with different start indexes or end indexes are counted as
# different substrings even they consist of same characters.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "abc"
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c".
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "aaa"
#     Output: 6
#     Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
#     
#
