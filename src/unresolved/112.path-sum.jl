# 
# Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path
# such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
# 
# **Note:**  A leaf is a node with no children.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
# Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,
# 
#     
#     
#           **5**
#          **/** \
#         **4**   8
#        **/**   / \
#       **11**  13  4
#      /  **\**      \
#     7    **2**      1
#     
# 
# return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.
