# Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.
# 
# You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is
# separated by the `' '` character.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
# If `file.txt` has the following content:
# 
#     
#     
#     name age
#     alice 21
#     ryan 30
#     
# 
# Output the following:
# 
#     
#     
#     name alice ryan
#     age 21 30
#     
#
