# Given a string _**s**_ , you can convert it to a palindrome by adding
# characters in front of it. Find and return the shortest palindrome you can
# find by performing this transformation.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "aacecaaa"
#     Output: "aaacecaaa"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "abcd"
#     Output: "dcbabcd"
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
#   * `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
