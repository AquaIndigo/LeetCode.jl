# 
# Find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `N`.
# 
# Recall that a number is _prime_ if it's only divisors are 1 and itself, and it
# is greater than 1.
# 
# For example, 2,3,5,7,11 and 13 are primes.
# 
# Recall that a number is a _palindrome_ if it reads the same from left to right
# as it does from right to left.
# 
# For example, 12321 is a palindrome.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 6
#     Output: 7
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 8
#     Output: 11
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: 13
#     Output: 101
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * `1 <= N <= 10^8`
#   * The answer is guaranteed to exist and be less than `2 * 10^8`.
