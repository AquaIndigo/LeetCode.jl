# 
# Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return _their sum as a binary string_.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: a = "11", b = "1"
#     Output: "100"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
#     Output: "10101"
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104`
#   * `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
#   * Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
