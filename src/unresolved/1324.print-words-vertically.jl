# 
# Given a string `s`. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which
# they appear in `s`.  
# Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces when is
# necessary. (Trailing spaces are not allowed).  
# Each word would be put on only one column and that in one column there will be
# only one word.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "HOW ARE YOU"
#     Output: ["HAY","ORO","WEU"]
#     Explanation: Each word is printed vertically. 
#      "HAY"
#      "ORO"
#      "WEU"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
#     Output: ["TBONTB","OEROOE","   T"]
#     Explanation: Trailing spaces is not allowed. 
#     "TBONTB"
#     "OEROOE"
#     "   T"
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "CONTEST IS COMING"
#     Output: ["CIC","OSO","N M","T I","E N","S G","T"]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= s.length <= 200`
#   * `s` contains only upper case English letters.
#   * It's guaranteed that there is only one space between 2 words.
