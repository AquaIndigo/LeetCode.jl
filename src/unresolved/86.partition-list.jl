# Given a linked list and a value _x_ , partition it such that all nodes less
# than _x_ come before nodes greater than or equal to _x_.
# 
# You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the
# two partitions.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, _x_ = 3
#     Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
