# 
# Given two integer arrays `A` and `B`, return the maximum length of an subarray
# that appears in both arrays.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     A: [1,2,3,2,1]
#     B: [3,2,1,4,7]
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: 
#     The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. 1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000
#   2. 0 <= A[i], B[i] < 100
