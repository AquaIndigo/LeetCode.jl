# 
# Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
# 
# You may **not** modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes itself may
# be changed.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/swap_ex1.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
#     Output: [2,1,4,3]
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: head = []
#     Output: []
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: head = [1]
#     Output: [1]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
#   * `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
