# 
# Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray within an array
# (containing at least one number) which has the largest product.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [2,3,-2,4]
#     Output: 6
#     Explanation:  [2,3] has the largest product 6.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [-2,0,-1]
#     Output: 0
#     Explanation:  The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
