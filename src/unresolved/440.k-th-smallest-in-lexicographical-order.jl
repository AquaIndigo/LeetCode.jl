# 
# Given integers `n` and `k`, find the lexicographically k-th smallest integer
# in the range from `1` to `n`.
# 
# Note: 1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 109.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     n: 13   k: 2
#     
#     Output:
#     10
#     
#     Explanation:
#     The lexicographical order is [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], so the second smallest number is 10.
