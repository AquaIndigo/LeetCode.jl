# 
# Given an array A of strings, find any smallest string that contains each
# string in `A` as a substring.
# 
# We may assume that no string in `A` is substring of another string in `A`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
#     Output: "alexlovesleetcode"
#     Explanation: All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
#     Output: "gctaagttcatgcatc"
# 
# 
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   1. `1 <= A.length <= 12`
#   2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`
