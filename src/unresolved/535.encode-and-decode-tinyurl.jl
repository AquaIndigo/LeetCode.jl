# 
# TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as
# `https://leetcode.comhttps://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such
# as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.
# 
# Design the `encode` and `decode` methods for the TinyURL service. There is no
# restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to
# ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded
# to the original URL.
