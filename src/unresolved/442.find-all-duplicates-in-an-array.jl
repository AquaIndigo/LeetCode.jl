# 
# Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ _n_ ( _n_ = size of array), some
# elements appear **twice** and others appear **once**.
# 
# Find all the elements that appear **twice** in this array.
# 
# Could you do it without extra space and in O( _n_ ) runtime?
# 
# **Example:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
#     
#     Output:
#     [2,3]
#
