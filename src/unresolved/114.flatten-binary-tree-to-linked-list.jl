# 
# Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.
# 
# For example, given the following tree:
# 
#     
#     
#         1
#        / \
#       2   5
#      / \   \
#     3   4   6
#     
# 
# The flattened tree should look like:
# 
#     
#     
#     1
#      \
#       2
#        \
#         3
#          \
#           4
#            \
#             5
#              \
#               6
#
