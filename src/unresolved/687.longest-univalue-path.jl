# 
# Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _the length of the longest path,
# where each node in the path has the same value_. This path may or may not pass
# through the root.
# 
# **The length of the path** between two nodes is represented by the number of
# edges between them.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/ex1.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [5,4,5,1,1,5]
#     Output: 2
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/ex2.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: root = [1,4,5,4,4,5]
#     Output: 2
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
#   * `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
#   * The depth of the tree will not exceed `1000`.
