# 
# Given a `rows x cols` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the
# largest rectangle containing only `1`'s and return _its area_.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
# ![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/maximal.jpg)
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
#     Output: 6
#     Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: matrix = []
#     Output: 0
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: matrix = [["0"]]
#     Output: 0
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: matrix = [["1"]]
#     Output: 1
#     
# 
# **Example 5:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: matrix = [["0","0"]]
#     Output: 0
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `rows == matrix.length`
#   * `cols == matrix.length`
#   * `0 <= row, cols <= 200`
#   * `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
