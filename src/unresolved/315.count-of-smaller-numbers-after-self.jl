# 
# You are given an integer array _nums_ and you have to return a new _counts_
# array. The _counts_ array has the property where `counts[i]` is the number of
# smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [5,2,6,1]
#     Output: [2,1,1,0]
#     Explanation:
#     To the right of 5 there are **2** smaller elements (2 and 1).
#     To the right of 2 there is only **1** smaller element (1).
#     To the right of 6 there is **1** smaller element (1).
#     To the right of 1 there is **0** smaller element.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `0 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
#   * `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
