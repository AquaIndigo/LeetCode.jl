# 
# Write a program that outputs the string representation of numbers from 1 to
# _n_.
# 
# But for multiples of three it should output “Fizz” instead of the number and
# for the multiples of five output “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of
# both three and five output “FizzBuzz”.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     n = 15,
#     
#     Return:
#     [
#         "1",
#         "2",
#         "Fizz",
#         "4",
#         "Buzz",
#         "Fizz",
#         "7",
#         "8",
#         "Fizz",
#         "Buzz",
#         "11",
#         "Fizz",
#         "13",
#         "14",
#         "FizzBuzz"
#     ]
