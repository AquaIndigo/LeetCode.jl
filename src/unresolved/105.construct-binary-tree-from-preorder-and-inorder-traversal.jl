# 
# Given preorder and inorder traversal of a tree, construct the binary tree.
# 
# **Note:**  
# You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree.
# 
# For example, given
# 
#     
#     
#     preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
#     inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
# 
# Return the following binary tree:
# 
#     
#     
#         3
#        / \
#       9  20
#         /  \
#        15   7
