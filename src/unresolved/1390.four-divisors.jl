# 
# Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of divisors of the integers in
# that array that have exactly four divisors.
# 
# If there is no such integer in the array, return `0`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: nums = [21,4,7]
#     Output: 32
#     Explanation:
#     21 has 4 divisors: 1, 3, 7, 21
#     4 has 3 divisors: 1, 2, 4
#     7 has 2 divisors: 1, 7
#     The answer is the sum of divisors of 21 only.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
#   * `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
