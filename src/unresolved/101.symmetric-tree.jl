# 
# Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric
# around its center).
# 
# For example, this binary tree `[1,2,2,3,4,4,3]` is symmetric:
# 
#     
#     
#         1
#        / \
#       2   2
#      / \ / \
#     3  4 4  3
#     
# 
# 
# 
# But the following `[1,2,2,null,3,null,3]` is not:
# 
#     
#     
#         1
#        / \
#       2   2
#        \   \
#        3    3
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Follow up:** Solve it both recursively and iteratively.
