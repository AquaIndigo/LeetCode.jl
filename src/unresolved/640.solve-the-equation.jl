# 
# Solve a given equation and return the value of `x` in the form of string
# "x=#value". The equation contains only '+', '-' operation, the variable `x`
# and its coefficient.
# 
# If there is no solution for the equation, return "No solution".
# 
# If there are infinite solutions for the equation, return "Infinite solutions".
# 
# If there is exactly one solution for the equation, we ensure that the value of
# `x` is an integer.
# 
# **Example 1:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
#     Output: "x=2"
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "x=x"
#     Output: "Infinite solutions"
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "2x=x"
#     Output: "x=0"
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "2x+3x-6x=x+2"
#     Output: "x=-1"
#     
# 
# **Example 5:**  
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: "x=x+2"
#     Output: "No solution"
#
