# 
# Given a **positive** integer `num`, output its complement number. The
# complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: num = 5
#     Output: 2
#     Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: num = 1
#     Output: 0
#     Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The given integer `num` is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
#   * `num >= 1`
#   * You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer's binary representation.
#   * This question is the same as 1009: <https://leetcode.comhttps://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/>
