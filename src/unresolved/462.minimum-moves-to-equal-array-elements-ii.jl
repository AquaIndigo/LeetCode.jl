# 
# Given a **non-empty** integer array, find the minimum number of moves required
# to make all array elements equal, where a move is incrementing a selected
# element by 1 or decrementing a selected element by 1.
# 
# You may assume the array's length is at most 10,000.
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     [1,2,3]
#     
#     Output:
#     2
#     
#     Explanation:
#     Only two moves are needed (remember each move increments or decrements one element):
#     
#     [1,2,3]  =>  [2,2,3]  =>  [2,2,2]
#
