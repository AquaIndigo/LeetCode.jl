# 
# Given an integer array, your task is to find all the different possible
# increasing subsequences of the given array, and the length of an increasing
# subsequence should be at least 2.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [4, 6, 7, 7]
#     Output: [[4, 6], [4, 7], [4, 6, 7], [4, 6, 7, 7], [6, 7], [6, 7, 7], [7,7], [4,7,7]]
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * The length of the given array will not exceed 15.
#   * The range of integer in the given array is [-100,100].
#   * The given array may contain duplicates, and two equal integers should also be considered as a special case of increasing sequence.
