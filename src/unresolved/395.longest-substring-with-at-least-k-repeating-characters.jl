# 
# Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return _the length of the longest
# substring of_ `s` _such that the frequency of each character in this substring
# is greater than or equal to_ `k`.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
#     Output: 5
#     Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `1 <= s.length <= 104`
#   * `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
#   * `1 <= k <= 105`
