# 
# Given a string `s` that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can
# perform at most `k` operations on that string.
# 
# In one operation, you can choose **any** character of the string and change it
# to any other uppercase English character.
# 
# Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you
# can get after performing the above operations.
# 
# **Note:**  
# Both the string's length and _k_ will not exceed 104.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     s = "ABAB", k = 2
#     
#     Output:
#     4
#     
#     Explanation:
#     Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input:
#     s = "AABABBA", k = 1
#     
#     Output:
#     4
#     
#     Explanation:
#     Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
#     The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
#
