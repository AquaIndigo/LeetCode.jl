# 
# X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees,
# we get a valid number that is different from X.  Each digit must be rotated -
# we cannot choose to leave it alone.
# 
# A number is valid if each digit remains a digit after rotation. 0, 1, and 8
# rotate to themselves; 2 and 5 rotate to each other (on this case they are
# rotated in a different direction, in other words 2 or 5 gets mirrored); 6 and
# 9 rotate to each other, and the rest of the numbers do not rotate to any other
# number and become invalid.
# 
# Now given a positive number `N`, how many numbers X from `1` to `N` are good?
# 
#     
#     
#     **Example:**
#     Input: 10
#     Output: 4
#     Explanation: 
#     There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
#     Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotating.
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * N  will be in range `[1, 10000]`.
