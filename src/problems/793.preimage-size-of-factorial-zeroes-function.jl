# 
# Let `f(x)` be the number of zeroes at the end of `x!`. (Recall that `x! = 1 *
# 2 * 3 * ... * x`, and by convention, `0! = 1`.)
# 
# For example, `f(3) = 0` because 3! = 6 has no zeroes at the end, while `f(11)
# = 2` because 11! = 39916800 has 2 zeroes at the end. Given `K`, find how many
# non-negative integers `x` have the property that `f(x) = K`.
# 
#     
#     
#     **Example 1:**
#     Input: K = 0
#     Output: 5
#     Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with K = 0 zeroes.
#     
#     **Example 2:**
#     Input: K = 5
#     Output: 0
#     Explanation: There is no x such that x! ends in K = 5 zeroes.
#     
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * `K` will be an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.
