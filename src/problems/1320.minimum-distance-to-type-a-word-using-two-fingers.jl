# 
# You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the XY plane, where each English
# uppercase letter is located at some coordinate, for example, the letter **A**
# is located at coordinate **(0,0)** , the letter **B** is located at coordinate
# **(0,1)** , the letter **P** is located at coordinate **(2,3)** and the letter
# **Z** is located at coordinate **(4,1)**.
# 
# Given the string `word`, return the minimum total distance to type such string
# using only two fingers. The distance between coordinates **(x 1,y1)** and **(x
# 2,y2)** is **|x 1 \- x2| + |y1 \- y2|**.
# 
# Note that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so
# don't count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to
# start at the first letter or the first two letters.
# 
# 
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: word = "CAKE"
#     Output: 3
#     Explanation: Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "CAKE" is: 
#     Finger 1 on letter 'C' -> cost = 0 
#     Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'C' to letter 'A' = 2 
#     Finger 2 on letter 'K' -> cost = 0 
#     Finger 2 on letter 'E' -> cost = Distance from letter 'K' to letter 'E' = 1 
#     Total distance = 3
#     
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: word = "HAPPY"
#     Output: 6
#     Explanation:
#     Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "HAPPY" is:
#     Finger 1 on letter 'H' -> cost = 0
#     Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'H' to letter 'A' = 2
#     Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = 0
#     Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = Distance from letter 'P' to letter 'P' = 0
#     Finger 1 on letter 'Y' -> cost = Distance from letter 'A' to letter 'Y' = 4
#     Total distance = 6
#     
# 
# **Example 3:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: word = "NEW"
#     Output: 3
#     
# 
# **Example 4:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: word = "YEAR"
#     Output: 7
#     
# 
# 
# 
# **Constraints:**
# 
#   * `2 <= word.length <= 300`
#   * Each `word[i]` is an English uppercase letter.
#
