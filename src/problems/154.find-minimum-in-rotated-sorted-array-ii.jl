# 
# Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to
# you beforehand.
# 
# (i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).
# 
# Find the minimum element.
# 
# The array may contain duplicates.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [1,3,5]
#     Output: 1
# 
# **Example 2:**
# 
#     
#     
#     Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
#     Output: 0
# 
# **Note:**
# 
#   * This is a follow up problem to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.comhttps://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/).
#   * Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
