# 
# Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the
# tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the **longest** path
# between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the
# root.
# 
# **Example:**  
# Given a binary tree  
# 
#     
#     
#               1
#              / \
#             2   3
#            / \     
#           4   5    
#     
# 
# Return **3** , which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].
# 
# **Note:** The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of
# edges between them.
